# Better Front-End Extension Pack

VSCode has great tools for Front-End development. But the tools can be powerful.  
To fix this, I made this extension pack that add powers to VSCode.

## List of extensions built-in

- bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss
- csstools.postcss
- firefox-devtools.vscode-firefox-debug
- ritwickdey.liveserver

**Enjoy!**
